## Qibud WebApp
Based on the best stack i found (thx Teoman Soygul):

KOAN Stack is a boilerplate that provides a nice starting point for full stack JavaScript Web development with [Koa](http://koajs.com/), [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), and [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/) along with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) and [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/WebSockets). A summary of tech stack:
* **Client**: AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap with pure html partials (no server side rendering so it's fully static and CDN ready). Bower packages are located at `client\bower_packages`.
* **Server**: Koa for RESTful API on top of Node.js v0.11+ with the use of `--harmony` and generators.
* WebSockets along with JSON-RPC is used for real-time client-server communication and browser sync.
* Passport.js is used for social auth. Instead of auth cookies, we use JWT along with HTML5 *local storage*.
* Grunt tasks are used to facilitate development and testing.
* MongoDB for persistence. Possibly more to be added.


## Getting Started
Make sure that you have Node.js (v0.11 or above) and MongoDB (running on the default port 27017) installed on your computer. To get started with KOAN stack, do following:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/soygul/koan.git
cd koan
npm install
npm start
```

Your application should run on the 3000 port so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). If you want to run tests, simply type:

```bash
npm test
```

## Configuration
All configuration is specified in the [server/config](server/config/) folder, particularly the [config.js](server/config/config.js) file. Here you can hook up any social app keys if you want integration with Twitter, Facebook, or Google.

## Heroku Deployment
Before you start make sure you have <a href="https://toolbelt.heroku.com/">heroku toolbelt</a> installed.

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial version"
heroku apps:create
heroku addons:add mongohq
heroku labs:enable websockets
heroku config:add NODE_ENV=production
git push heroku master
heroku open
```

## Receiving updates from upstream
Whenever we update KOAN's repo, you can just fetch the changes and merge them into your project with git.

## Testing
You can run all the tests with `npm test`. Tests are run with:
* Client (unit): Jasmine + Karma (Angular default)
* Client (e2e): Jasmine + Protractor (Angular default)
* Server: Mocha/SuperTest/Should (Koa default)

## Credits
Client side is entirely based on: [Angular Seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed). Server side simply utilizes generally accepted Koa middleware and Node.js best practices.

## The Name
The project name is an acronym for Koa, Angular, and Node. It also is the name for a Zen Buddhist riddle used to focus the mind during meditation and to develop intuitive thinking.
